<b>Description 📋</b>
---
Embark on a journey of discovery with this engaging learning project in game development using the Processing programming language. In this basic 2D grid-based game, players navigate through a dynamic environment to collect goodies and score points. Let's dive into the magic behind the scenes:

<b>Variables 📊</b> 
---
Various variables such as anz_felder (number of fields), feld_gr (field size), spielerX, spielerY (player's coordinates), goodieX, goodieY (goodie's coordinates), and score orchestrate the game's state.

<b>Setup 🎨</b>  
---
The setup() function sets the stage by initializing the game window size, positioning players and goodies randomly within the grid, and orchestrating the rhythm with frame rate configurations.

<b>Movement 🚶</b>
---
Players unleash their prowess with movement controls using the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys, conquering the grid's dimensions with grace and precision.

<b>Drawing 🎨:</b>  
---
The artistic draw() function breathes life into the canvas, clearing the slate, orchestrating player movements, detecting collisions with goodies, and updating the grid dynamically with each interaction.

<b>Scoring 🏆:</b> 
---
Every triumph in collecting a goodie adds 100 points to the player's glory, paving the way to triumph and victory.

<b>Display 💬:</b>
---
The illustrious scoreboard proudly showcases the player's current score, serving as a beacon of accomplishment amidst the game's enchanting ambiance.

<b>How to Run ⌨️</b>
---
<b>Prepare:</b> Ensure your realm is fortified with the mighty Processing installed on your system.
<b>Launch:</b> Transport the provided code into a new Processing sketch, igniting the spark of creation.
<b>Embark:</b> Set forth on your adventure as the game window materializes before your very eyes.
<b>Navigate:</b> Harness the power of 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys to guide the player, gathering goodies and amassing points.

Description:
Embark on a journey of discovery with this engaging learning project in game development using the Processing programming language. In this basic 2D grid-based game, players navigate through a dynamic environment to collect goodies and score points. Let's dive into the magic behind the scenes:

Variables: 📊 Various variables such as anz_felder (number of fields), feld_gr (field size), spielerX, spielerY (player's coordinates), goodieX, goodieY (goodie's coordinates), and score orchestrate the game's state.

Setup: 🎨 The setup() function sets the stage by initializing the game window size, positioning players and goodies randomly within the grid, and orchestrating the rhythm with frame rate configurations.

Movement: 🚶 Players unleash their prowess with movement controls using the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys, conquering the grid's dimensions with grace and precision.

Drawing: 🎨 The artistic draw() function breathes life into the canvas, clearing the slate, orchestrating player movements, detecting collisions with goodies, and updating the grid dynamically with each interaction.

Scoring: 🏆 Every triumph in collecting a goodie adds 100 points to the player's glory, paving the way to triumph and victory.

Display: 💬 The illustrious scoreboard proudly showcases the player's current score, serving as a beacon of accomplishment amidst the game's enchanting ambiance.

How to Run:

Prepare: Ensure your realm is fortified with the mighty Processing installed on your system.
Launch: Transport the provided code into a new Processing sketch, igniting the spark of creation.
Embark: Set forth on your adventure as the game window materializes before your very eyes.
Navigate: Harness the power of 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys to guide the player, gathering goodies and amassing points.
This project, a testament to the spirit of learning and exploration, welcomes feedback and suggestions for enhancements as I embark on this journey of discovery! Should queries arise or guidance be sought, fear not to venture forth and seek enlightenment.
